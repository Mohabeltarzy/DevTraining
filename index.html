            <p>The African lion is one of the most iconic and revered mammals in the world.
            With its strong jaw, powerful body, and fierce roar â€“ which can be heard several miles away,
            it is easy to see why this species has been admired throughout history.
            While the species once roamed widely in parts of Europe and Asia, 
            numbers of lion have declined significantly in recent years, with lions now only found in parts of Africa.
